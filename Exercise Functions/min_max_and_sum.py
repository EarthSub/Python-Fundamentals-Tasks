# Write a program that receives a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space.
# It should print the min and max values of the given numbers and the sum of all the numbers in the list.
# Use min(), max() and sum().
#
# The output should be as follows:
#
# Â· On the first line: "The minimum number is {minimum number}"
#
# Â· On the second line: "The maximum number is {maximum number}"
#
# Â· On the third line: "The sum number is: {sum of all numbers}"


#               Example

# Input                           Output
#
#                                 The minimum number is 2
# 2 4 6                           The maximum number is 6
#                                 The sum number is: 12
#
#                                 The minimum number is 2
# 12 52 11 53 2 5 45              The maximum number is 53
#                                 The sum number is: 183

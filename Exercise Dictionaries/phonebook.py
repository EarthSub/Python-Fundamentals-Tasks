# Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.

# Each entry should have a name and a number (both strings) separated by a "-".
# If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.

# After filling out the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N.
# Your program should be able to perform a search of contact by name and
# print its details in the format: "{name} -> {number}".
# In case the contact isn't found, print: "Contact {name} does not exist."

#               Examples

# Input                           Output

# Adam-0888080808                 Contact Mery does not exist.
# 2                               Adam -> 0888080808

# Write a program that keeps the information about courses. Each course has a name and registered students.
# You will be receiving a course name and a student name until you receive the command "end".
# You should register each user into the corresponding course. If the given course does not exist, add it.
# When you receive the command "end", print the courses with their names and total registered users. For each course,
# print the registered users.

# Input
# 路 Until the "end" command is received, you will be receiving input lines in the format:
# "{course_name} : {student_name}"
# 路 The product data is always delimited by " : "

# Output
# 路 Print the information about each course in the following format: "{course_name}: {registered_students}"
# 路 Print the information about each student in the following format: "-- {student_name}"

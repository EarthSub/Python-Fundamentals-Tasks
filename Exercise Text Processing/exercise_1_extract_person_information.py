# Write a program that reads N lines of strings and extracts the name and the age of a given person:

# Â· The person's name will be surrounded by "@" and "|" in the format "@{name}|".

# Â· The person's age will be surrounded by "#" and "*" in the format "#{age}*".

# Example: "Hello my name is @Peter| and I am #20* years old."

# For each found name-age pair, print a line in the following format "{name} is {age} years old."


#                             Example

# Input                                                   Output

# 2                                                       George is 18 years old.
# Here is a name @George| and an age #18*                 Billy is 35 years old.
# Another name @Billy| #35* is his age

# random name @lilly| random digits #5*age                Marry is 19 years old.
# @Marry| with age #19*                                   Garry is 48 years old.
# here Comes @ Garry | he is  # 48* years old
